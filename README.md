## About the project

Project developed during the course "JavaScript na Web: armazenando dados no navegador", at Alura formation on JavaScript. 

For those who always forgets itens while preping for a trip, this projects aims at making a dinamic list in which the user can add, delete and update itens and quantities for his or her travel bag. 

Also, local storage was used to save all data into the browser, so that information is not lost when the browser is refreshed.

## Technologies

For this projected, the initial HTML and CSS codes were given, so that JS was the language used to implement all features desired for the course.

## Experience

It was my first experience working with local storage. Some properties of localStorage were used (getItem, setItem), as well of methods to transform the strings saved in the local storage into objects to be worked with using JavaScript. 

Since the local storage was overwritten when some itens were deleted from the list and then added again, I had to learn and understand how to use some properties for arrays that I still hadn't used (findIndex and find).
